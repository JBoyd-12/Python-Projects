1. An office building has 4 floors (G, 2, 3, 4 ) and 1 elevator.
2. The elevator has a capacity of 12 people.
3. On average, six workers arrive per minute between 8:00 am and 9:00 am. 
   (Inter-arrival rate is exponential with mean = 0.1667). 
4. Workers are equally likely to be going to 2nd, 3rd, or 4th floor. p(2) = p(3) = 
   p(4) = 1/3.
5. Travel time of the elevator from floor to floor (in minutes) in the table below.
6. The elevator only stops at a given floor if someone is getting off at that floor. 
7. When the elevator stops at a floor, the door remains open for .5 minutes, 
   regardless of how many passengers are getting on or off.
8. If there are more than 12 people waiting on the elevator, some people will 
   use the stairs. A person going to the second floor will have a .50 chance of 
   walking. A person going to the third floor will have a .33 chance of walking. A 
   person going to the fourth floor will have a .10 chance of walking.
9. The effect of workers riding the elevator DOWN during this time period is 
   trivial and can be disregarded.
